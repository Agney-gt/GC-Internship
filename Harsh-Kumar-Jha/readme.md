# üîç Google Search Results Scraper

A lightweight Python-based web scraper that extracts search results from Google using Selenium with stealth features to bypass bot detection.

## üìã Features

- **Stealth Mode**: Anti-detection features to avoid Google's bot protection
- **Full Metadata Extraction**: Captures titles, URLs, and descriptions
- **Clean URLs**: Removes Google's redirect tracking parameters
- **Robust Selectors**: Works with Google's latest HTML structure (2025)
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure management with fallback strategies
- **Simple Output**: Clean console display of results

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- **Python 3.7+**
- **Google Chrome** browser installed
- **ChromeDriver** (matching your Chrome version)

## üì¶ Installation

### 1. Clone or Download the Script

```bash
mkdir google-scraper
cd google-scraper
```

### 2. Install Required Libraries

```bash
pip install selenium
```

### 3. Download ChromeDriver

Download ChromeDriver from [https://chromedriver.chromium.org/](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/) matching your Chrome browser version, or use:

```bash
# For automated installation (requires webdriver-manager)
pip install webdriver-manager
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Usage

1. Save the script as `search_google.py`
2. Run from terminal:

```bash
python search_google.py
```

### Custom Search Query

Modify the search query in the script:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    results = scrape_google("Your Search Query Here")
    print(f"‚úÖ Extracted {len(results)} results")
```

### Example Output

```
üîç Searching: Software Engineering

[1] Software engineering - Wikipedia
    URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering
    DESC: Software engineering is a branch of both computer science and engineering focused on designing, developing, testing...

[2] Software Engineering Tutorial - GeeksforGeeks
    URL: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering/
    DESC: Software Engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software...
```

## üìä Data Structure

Each result is returned as a dictionary:

```python
{
    'title': 'Result Title',
    'url': 'https://example.com/page',
    'description': 'Description snippet from search results...'
}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### 1. **Stealth Configuration**
```python
options.add_argument('--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled')
driver.execute_cdp_cmd('Page.addScriptToEvaluateOnNewDocument', {
    'source': 'Object.defineProperty(navigator, "webdriver", {get: () => undefined});'
})
```
Hides automation signatures that Google detects.

### 2. **Cookie Handling**
Automatically clicks "Accept" or "Reject" on cookie popups.

### 3. **Search Execution**
Finds the search box, enters query, and submits the form.

### 4. **Data Extraction**
- Finds all `<h3>` heading elements (search result titles)
- Navigates to parent `<a>` tags to extract URLs
- Locates description containers using multiple XPath selectors
- Cleans Google redirect URLs to get direct links

### 5. **Result Filtering**
Skips Google's own internal links and returns up to 5 clean results.

## üîß Configuration Options

### Change Number of Results

```python
# In the scrape_google function, modify this line:
if len(results) >= 5:  # Change 5 to your desired number
    break
```

### Adjust Wait Times

```python
time.sleep(5)  # Change from 5 to 3 for faster (but less reliable) scraping
```

### Disable Headless Mode (See Browser)

```python
# Remove or comment out this line if you want to see the browser:
# options.add_argument('--headless')
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Getting 0 Results

**Solution**: Increase wait time after search
```python
time.sleep(5)  # Try increasing to 7 or 10
```

### Issue: ChromeDriver Version Mismatch

**Solution**: Update ChromeDriver to match your Chrome version
```bash
# Check Chrome version
google-chrome --version  # Linux/Mac
# or check in Chrome: Menu ‚Üí Help ‚Üí About Google Chrome

# Download matching ChromeDriver
```

### Issue: "No description available"

**Solution**: Google's HTML structure varies by region. The script has multiple fallback selectors but may occasionally miss descriptions.

### Issue: Script Detected as Bot

**Solution**: Add random delays or use residential proxies
```python
import random
time.sleep(random.uniform(3, 7))  # Random delays
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Legal & Ethical Considerations

- **Terms of Service**: Google's ToS prohibits automated scraping
- **Rate Limiting**: Don't send too many requests (risk of IP ban)
- **Personal Use Only**: This tool is for educational purposes
- **Consider Alternatives**: Use official APIs like Google Custom Search API or SerpApi for production

### Limitations

- **HTML Changes**: Google frequently updates their HTML structure
- **Detection Risk**: May be blocked if used excessively
- **No Pagination**: Currently scrapes only the first page
- **Regional Differences**: Results vary by location/language

## üéØ Best Practices

1. **Add delays** between requests (3-5 seconds minimum)
2. **Use proxies** for large-scale scraping
3. **Cache results** to avoid redundant requests
4. **Rotate user agents** for better stealth
5. **Monitor error rates** and adjust strategy accordingly

## üìö Dependencies

```txt
selenium>=4.0.0
```

Optional:
```txt
webdriver-manager>=3.8.0  # Auto-manages ChromeDriver
pandas>=1.5.0             # For CSV export
```

## üìÑ License

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If Google updates their HTML structure and selectors break, please submit updated XPath/CSS selectors via pull request.

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check that ChromeDriver matches your Chrome version
2. Verify internet connection
3. Try increasing wait times
4. Check if Google is accessible in your region
