# 🧠 Job Scraper — Automated Job Listing Collector

### 🚀 Project Overview
This project is a **web scraper** designed to collect job listings from online job portals like *Indeed*. It helps automate the process of searching for job opportunities, extracting key details such as **job title, company name, location, and description summary**.

The project is built with **Python**, using **BeautifulSoup**, **Requests**, and **Pandas** for data extraction, cleaning, and storage. It’s structured to be efficient, reusable, and production-ready.

## 🔧 Configuration Options
You can edit the following constants in `job_scraper.py`:
```python
SEARCH_QUERY = "python developer"  # Change the job title
LOCATION = "remote"                # Change the location
MAX_PAGES = 5                      # Number of pages to scrape
OUTPUT_FILE = "job_listings.csv"   # Output CSV file name
```
